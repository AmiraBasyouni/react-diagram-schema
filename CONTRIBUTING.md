# Contributing to react-diagram-schema

Thank you for your interest in contributing! üéâ  
`react-diagram-schema` is a standalone CLI tool that generates a JSON schema from React source code, designed to integrate with [react-diagram-visualizer](https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-visualizer) for visualizing [ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev/)-based UML diagrams. We aim to make React component architecture more **visual, structured, and developer-friendly**, and your help can make a big difference.

## How to Get Started

1. Fork this repository

- visit [react-diagram-schema](https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-schema)
- click on the button labeled "Fork"
- alternatively, if you have gh set up on your terminal, use the following command:
  ```bash
  gh repo fork AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-schema
  ```

2. Clone your fork

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/react-diagram-schema.git
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## How You Can Contribute

We welcome:

- **Bug fixes** - spotted something weird? Open an issue or submit a fix.
- **Schema enhancements** - improve how we extract data like props or states from React files.
- **Plugin ideas** - suggest or prototype tools that consume the schema (e.g., a linter using the schema to enforce ‚Äòno circular dependencies‚Äô or a VS Code extension showing component trees).
- **Performance improvements** - optimize parsing for large React projects.
- **Documentation updates** - even fixing a typo helps!

Please avoid:

- Large refactors without discussion.
- Adding unrelated dependencies.

## Proposing Changes

Before starting major work:

- **Open an issue** describing your proposal.
- If relevant, share an example schema and how your change would improve the output.

Small fixes (typos, minor code tweaks) can skip this step.

## Coding Standards

- **Formatting**: We use Prettier and ESLint. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before submitting.
- **File Naming**: camelCase for utilities, PascalCase for core modules.
- **Schema Shape**: Keep the structure consistent with the current spec:

```js
{"ComponentName::filepath": {"name": "App", "descendants": ["Header"], "location": {"line": 7}}}
```

Note: you can find the full schema in [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-schema)

## Pull Requests

1. **Branch** from main:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix-bug-header
   ```

2. **Write commits in [Coniventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style**:  
   Use a prefix like `fix`, `feat`, or `docs`, followed by the scope (e.g., `codeParser`, `readme`) and a brief description.

   Examples:

- `fix(codeParser): improve props parsing for RestElement`
- `feat(parser): ass support for React.lazy components`
- `docs(readme): clarify multi-file parsing usage`

3. **Push** your branch and open a pull request on GitHub.

4. Include **screenshots or schema output** in your pull request if your changes affect parsing or visualization (e.g., new schema fields or diagram updates).

## Testing your Changes

`react-diagram-schema` includes an automated test suite powered by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

**Running the tests**

- To run all tests:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- To run a specific test file:

  ```bash
  npx jest test/components.test.jsx
  ```

---

**Test types included**

- **Component detection tests**:  
  Validate that function-defined and inline components are correctly parsed.

- **Data extraction tests**:  
  Ensure props, states, context, and functions are accurately extracted from components.

- **Edge case tests**:  
  Handle tricky structures like nested components, default exports, and files with missing metadata.

---

**Adding new tests**

- Add test files under the `tests/` directory. Use a feature-based structure (e.g. `components.test.js`, `dataExtraction.test.js`, `edgeCases.test.js`).

- Use `parseCode(code, filePath)` as your entry point for schema generation.

- Keep tests isolated and easy to understand.  
  Example:

  ```JavaScript
  expect(result["MyComponent::file.js"].external.props).toContain("title");
  ```

- Prefer `Object.keys(result)` to validate which components are detected.  
  Example:
  ```js
  const keys = Object.keys(result);
  expect(keys).toContain(`App::${fakePath}`);
  ```

---

**Manual testing**

Automated tests catch most issues, but you can also test the CLI manually.

**Try parsing a single component**

1. Create a file `Header.jsx` in the directory `./test-components`
2. Add this component:

   ```JavaScript
   function Header(){
     return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
   }
   ```

3. From the root repo, run:

```bash
node ./src/build-schema.js ./test-components/ Header
```

4. You should see this output in your console:

   ```js
   {
     'Header::Header.jsx': {
       name: 'Header',
       description: '',
       descendants: [],
       internal: { states: [], functions: [] },
       external: { props: [], context: [], constants: [] },
       location: { line: 1, filepath: 'Header.jsx' },
       unresolvedDescendants: undefined
     }
   }
   ```

---

**Visualizing the output**  
You can visualize `schema.json` using [react-diagram-visualizer](https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-visualizer)

1. Clone the visualizer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Place your `schema.json` file inside the `src/ folder.

3. run the app:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   You'll see a diagram rendered using ReactFlow.
   The diagram for `Header.jsx` should look like this (confirming the parser and visualizer are correctly wired):  
   ![React Flow diagram showing Header component node](assets/contributing-md-diagram-preview.png)

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If you change the `schema.json` file, stop the visualizer with `Ctrl+c`, then run `npm run dev` again to see your updates in the diagram.
