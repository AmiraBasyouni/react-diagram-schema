# Roadmap of react-diagram-schema

This file outlines the development goals for building the `react-diagram-schema` tool.

---

## Phase 1: MVP ‚Äì React to Schema

üèÅ Goal: extract meaningful metadata from React components and output it as structured JSON.

Output Schema Format:

```js
{
  "filename": "",
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "description": "",
      "descendants": [],
      "internal": { "states": [], "functions": [] },
      "external": { "props": [], "context": [], "constants": [] },
      "location": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

### To-Do List:

- [x] Parse React code using `@babel/parser`
- [x] Traverse AST with `@babel/traverse`
- [x] Extract component name and top-level logic
- [x] Extract internal states and functions
- [x] Extract external props, children, context
- [x] Output file-level schema with all component metadata
- [x] Extract descendants (will be used to infer component hierarchy in [react-diagram-visualizer](https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-visualizer))

#### üóí Note on Constants

The `constants` array will be skipped in the MVP.  
Support for per-file constant extraction (whether declared or imported) will be added **post-MVP**, after multi-file parsing is introduced.  
This will allow the schema to track constants at the **file level**, independent of any specific component.

#### üóí Note on Component Description

The description field (e.g., developer-authored comments like "Renders Form UI") will be skipped in the MVP.
Support for extracting this metadata will be added post-MVP, once parsing of inline comments is introduced.
This will allow the schema to capture each component's intended purpose in human-readable form, improving clarity and usefulness in diagrams.

## Phase 2: multi-file parsing support

üèÅ Goal: accept a directory as input and output the entire application in schema form

Output Schema Format:

```js
{
    "ComponentName::filepath": {
      "name": "",
      "description": "",
      "descendants": [],
      "internal": { "states": [], "functions": [] },
      "external": { "props": [], "context": [], "constants": [] },
      "location": { line, filepath }
    }
}
```

### To-Do List

- [x] Refactor parsing logic into a new file called `parseCode.js`
- [x] Use DFS approach to traverse files and generate a schema of the entire application, starting from root file
- [x] Log a warning for each unresolved descendant
- [ ] Add support for constants
- [ ] Add support for inline comments that populate the description field

---

## Phase 3: Maintainability

üèÅ Goal: on going maintenance support

### To-Do List

- [ ] Refactor `build-schema.js` logic and add inline comments to improve code readability and maintainability
- implement requested features
- resolve issues

## Potential Future Features

These are ideas we're considering or exploring. If you'd like to help shape them ‚Äî through feedback or contribution ‚Äî feel free to open an issue or PR.

1. **Visualizing enums or union types for props and state:**  
   Detect types like `variant: 'notice' | 'error' | 'success'` and display them visually or in a collapsible section.

2. **Basic schema validation:**  
   Validate that generated schemas meet the spec (e.g. missing keys, empty arrays).

3. **Support for TypeScript-only features:**  
   Deeper TypeScript support could enable more accurate parsing of generics, inferred types, and advanced annotations.
